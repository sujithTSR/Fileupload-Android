# Fileupload-Android
File upload to server from android

 Started with HttpUrlconnection, but later found retro-fit much more convinient. 

 So, Do make necessary changes within the code. i.e BASE_URL will be your server address. 

 The server which I made was a basic rails application, which is having a controller called pages.
