# Fileupload-Android
File upload to server from android

 Started with HttpUrlconnection, but later found retro-fit is much more convinient and easy.  

 So,Before getting started. Do make necessary changes within the code. i.e 
   Server Side: Create a server and host it locally, Get the url that is to be hit.
    
   Android side: update the BASE_URL with the server side URL. which should look like this (http:yourIPXXX:portnumber/pages/create)
